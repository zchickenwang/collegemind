  [ "Creating Home", "Sophie Ho", "UC Berkeley", "MY FIRST TWO YEARS of college were plagued by almost destabilizing waves of homesickness. Homesickness is a strange affliction: it’s one part nostalgia, three parts sadness, and two parts mixed happiness that you may be lucky enough to have a place, or people, who have resonated so deeply with you. I found myself being pulled away from the present over and over again when the waves of homesickness would set in. I would be eating with new friends at the dining halls and suddenly grow quiet, missing home, or I would be walking through campus and enjoying the feel of leaves under my sneakers and suddenly remember how the light bent around my childhood house. It was almost like nostalgic vertigo, to be plagued by homesickness; more so, it made me feel ashamed that I couldn’t fully let go of home and embrace all that college was for me. It was disorienting — especially as college became more and more familiar to me — to feel that I had two homes and be wracked, still, with homesickness and wanting to leave my new home. In my sophomore year of college, I decided to take a leadership position at my campus newspaper as a news editor. Until then, my time commitment to the paper had been moderate. I would write two to three articles per week, thoroughly enjoying the newsroom and running around campus talking to students and trying to find out what made people tick. When I became an editor, suddenly I was spending six days a week at the office, mentoring other writers and reporting breaking news. Midway through the year, I realized that the waves of homesickness had subsided, if they hadn’t disappeared entirely. I wasn’t sure why. It may have been the all-consuming nature of the job or it may have been that I was spending more time in the newsroom than at my apartment. It may have been that I had intentionally created a new space, a new home for myself that let me meld the best of the worlds I knew and loved — the family environment of my childhood home, found now in my coworkers and writers, and the intellectual atmosphere of college, found in the challenges I faced in the office environment each day. But perhaps the most important thing I learned was that college was the first place I was able to create an intentional space and home, and in that was power and agency that I hadn’t realized I possessed. Realizing I could make a big college campus as small as I wanted by pursuing my passions and interests was liberating and made me realize that in the future, I would be able to make any place my “home” because home had become less of a place and more of a feeling. College was the first place I realized how small I could make a big world, and that it was possible to have more than one home, from my sleepy hometown to a bustling campus like UC Berkeley." ],
  [ "Leaving Your Comfort Zone", "Celia Wright", "UC Berkeley", "IT’S 3 AM. I’m in Evanston, Chicago, sleeping on the couch of a student I met just six hours ago. To - morrow, I get on a tiny plane to Nicaragua, with two guys from Ohio State who I’ve known for only a month. I’m quietly crying myself to sleep because I’m afraid I’ll see a big spider when we get there. This is me about to embark on one of the greatest adventures of my life. Like all the other adventures, what started with lots of nerves ended with zero regrets. Experiences like these throughout college taught me that you only regret the opportunities you don’t take and that your trajectory is ultimately determined by the moments in which you leave your comfort zone. This advice is uncharacteristic, coming from a self-professed twenty-three-year-old grandmother whose idea of fun is knitting while watching murder mysteries from the safety of a down comforter. But I realize, looking back, that the best things that ever happened to me were ones that first scared me. I didn’t want to research water filters in the Nicaraguan jungle with two strangers. I didn’t want to pass between barbed wire-topped walls to conduct more research in the neighborhood of the MS-13 gang a year later. I didn’t want to beg 50,000 Ohio State students to elect me as their Student Body President. I didn’t want to pester the Provost about hiring new mental health counselors. I didn’t want to challenge the Department of Education on misguided policy. And most of all, when the dust settled and it was time to move on, I didn’t want to graduate.
Nevertheless, I pursued all of the above. With each aforementioned prospect, I sensed that the potential positive outcomes and outweighed nagging fears of failure or worse. I forced myself along, feigning comfort and confidence, until I naturally began to feel more comfortable and confident. When you’re presented with a frightening opportunity, I encourage you to seize it. The moment could range from going out with a new group of friends, to completing a hefty research project, to studying abroad where you don’t know a soul. You won’t regret it. And if your experience is like mine, the big spider you’re worried about will never come. " ],
  [ "Confidence is Key", "Isabella Sayyah", "USC", "I CAME TO USC to be a student, but the majority of my education took place outside of the class - room at my campus newspaper, the Daily Trojan. When I arrived on campus, a bright-eyed, bushytailed freshman, the first thing I wanted to do was get my name in print. After being accepted to the paper as a news writer, I got to work, my assignments getting more and more interesting as I established myself as a reliable staff reporter. I quickly rose through the ranks, from writer to Associate City Editor to News Editor to Associate Managing Editor then Managing Editor and, finally, Editor-in-Chief, during the fall semester of my senior year — my last semester at USC. I was excited to be editor-in-chief. No more pesky bosses; now I was in charge. And then the panic set in. I remember my first week on the job a manic energy took hold of me. I was writing emails at 3 a.m., my hands were constantly shaking, I lost my appetite. One aspect of the panic was constant self-doubt. I laid awake at night with questions running through my head. Was I a good leader? Was everyone laughing at me behind my back? Did they not understand my vision? Was I not setting a good tone for the office? It didn’t get any better when, in quick succession, a news and a lifestyle editor both resigned in the first week of production. Both had overcommitted themselves and were not prepared for the time commitment the Daily Trojan would be. All the feelings of doubt I had been trying to repress rushed through me. I wondered if their resignations were a refection on me. Luckily for me, though, I was at work when they told me. At home, at night, I could wade into my pools of insecurity. In the newsroom, I couldn’t waver. I first addressed the immediate problem: running the paper for the next couple of days without these essential editors there. Everyone pitched in an extra hand, and we got it done. But I also began thinking about the longer-term solution: replacing these editors. I met with my colleagues about who they thought might be good candidates, and, after some emails and meetings, an old news editor decided to come back. I decided to change the way we ran the lifestyle section and put the other editor in charge there. By week two, production had returned to normal. Though I might not have seen it then, having two editors quit did something for me. It threw me into crisis mode and forced me to concentrate on and solve the problem in front of me as fast as possible. There was no time or space for hesitation. I had confidence in my decisions because there wasn’t really another option. Even if all my doubts were true and my editors didn’t think I was a good leader, I knew that if I had faith in myself I would either convert them or they would fall by the wayside as I put my plans into action. Their attitudes didn’t matter, mine did. Having confidence in yourself might be a cheesy answer for the greatest lesson you learn in college, but it’s also one that’s true. College means plentiful opportunities — as a student, an academic, a leader, an athlete. But, to succeed at any one of those things, you have to believe in yourself and the choices you’ve made. " ],
  [ "The Power of Saying Yes", "Caroline Cannan", "UC Berkeley", "What have I learned you ask, Well this much I know is true: There are many great things that just may come If saying “yes” is something you do. After four years of college, And many a long day, I found that of all the lessons to be learned, Diving in with a “yes” is the best way The best way to approach life When it gives you the chance, To go somewhere new, help someone out, Or even learn to dance. Saying yes can bring so much That you never would have found Had you never taken the risk And left the solid ground. Although it’s easy to stay put Where things are certain and stable, Opening up and branching out May show you that you are able Able to push the limits, Go above and beyond. Sometimes all it takes is a simple “yes,” No need for wishes or a wand. My first “yes” of my college years Was a careful one for sure, With acceptances in hand And big envelopes filed with allure. After pro-con lists and visits, However would I choose Which way did my heart point? There, I was certain not to lose. Then once all settled on campus, The decisions didn’t end. In clubs and classes, outings and more, Came new places and new friends. Your chances to say “yes” May too come as a surprise. You never know just when you’ll see The opportunities before your eyes. It can come when walking through campus And someone soon calls out, “Are you interested in ( )?” You reply “yes,” and see what they are all about. The next thing you know, You commit to saying “yes” again, As you send in an application And cross your fingers you’ll get in. Or maybe the opportunity comes When sitting in a class. “Want to study together,” a new friend asks, Answer “yes” and the test you’ll pass. Maybe the chance will come When you’re trying to get ready for bed. But who knows what that late night adventure Will bring when a “yes” is said. Now of course I don’t suggest That you take it to an extreme. But a simple “yes” when the time is right Can bring all that you have dreamed. Not everything will come to you. Sometimes you must go pursue The opportunities you’ve been longing for, And you feel are long past due. Beware, along with a “yes” May come a greater task To which I say look around and find Someone you too can go ask. For every “yes” I’ve said myself, Another I’ve received. The world has a funny way of working out And leading you to believe In the power of agreeing And giving it your best shot, But there’s only one way to find out. Say “yes” and give it all you’ve got. Create opportunities for yourself, And say “yes” when they come to you. This is the best lesson I’ve learned, And hope that you will too." ],
  [ "Similarities in Yes", "Ron Tidhar", "Stanford", "(The night before this essay submission is due) I’m sitting in bed. It’s 12:40 a.m. Of course this is when I write my essay. All throughout college, this is when I’ve always written my essays. Somehow, I’ve never managed my time properly, and I’ve always ended up awake late at night, working on some - thing that’s due too soon, and for which I’ve done too little. So why am I starting so late this time? Well actually, the reason tonight is exactly what I want to talk about. It’s my answer to this awfully difficult question… Finals week has just about wrapped up. I’ve finished my master’s in Management Science & Engineering at Stanford University. My friends have finished their respective master’s, and so we went out to celebrate. The crew — that’s who I’m writ - ing about. There’s a Finnish guy, who’s an unbeaten arm-wrestling champ (not to mention the best programmer I’ve ever seen). There’s a 6’9” German übermensch. There’s a soon-to-be-married Tunisian, another German — this one is like James Bond (he goes skiing, surfing, and spearfishing, all in the same week — and not to mention studying). There’s a Californian who’s a natural surfer. I’m the Australian who likes to crack stupid jokes and drink beer. Those are just shallow characterizations, though. What is really amazing — what was really a surprise, and the foundation for the most important lesson that I learned in college — is that despite how far away we grew up and how different our experiences were, we are all so similar. In what way are we similar? We don’t look alike. We eat differently (no one seems to like my Vegemite toast…). We dress differently. But there’s one thing that we all look at the same way. It’s the one thing that got us to Stanford, and to where we are today. Opportunity. Sure, you could say that we’re all upper-middle class. We’re mostly from cohesive families, with supportive parents and good homes. But even still, it’s strange, how similar we are in this one respect — how we view the chances we were given. Our individual and collective attitude is always to just say “yes.” It’s led us to take a week-long trip to Europe, be - cause “why not?” It’s meant 6am wake-ups to go surfing at Santa Cruz and 5am wake-ups to go skiing at Lake Tahoe. It’s the attitude that keeps you up a bit later and gets you up a bit earlier. I look back on my degree, and all the best memories come from taking a chance in the face of nerves or fear. One of my best class experiences at Stanford — Steve Blank’s Lean Launchpad, where teams of students pursue their startups — was a last-minute decision to just go for it. I didn’t really think I’d be interested, it didn’t seem to ft into my original plans for the quarter and it seemed like too much work. But it turned out to be incredibly challenging and fulfilling. In the course, I discovered a passion for presenting, and became much closer to my team - mates, now my good friends. I’m thankful they pushed me to say “yes.” While I think it’s true that not everyone is given the same equal opportunities, the one universal truth is that opportunities are useless without subsequent action. They’re just fleeting thoughts. They don’t materialize. What’s empowering, and amazing, is that there are people from across the world that all have this same view; that nothing is actually hand - ed to you — only a chance to do something. But it’s up to you to go ahead and do it. And so, facing a group of friends who are so different, and yet so similar, I am comforted by two things. First, that people from such diverse backgrounds can be so close, and second, that they can do so by saying “yes,” and taking that risk." ],
  [ "Beyond the Comfort Zone", "Khushboo Bhatia", "UC Berkeley", "YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON who can achieve your goals, so work hard and actively seek the opportunities you need to help you get there. I had never really imagined or thought about what life would be like in college. It wasn’t until I stepped foot on my campus that I knew my college experience could be anything that I wanted it to be. I could be a very involved and active member of a million student organizations, or I could find an internship or job to secure what I would be doing when I left. Then – I realized I could do both of those and more! When I began my college journey, I was so excited by this idea of being able to do anything that I wanted, while, of course, balancing my academics. Once I moved onto campus, I immediately began to look for these opportunities. The first thing that piqued my interest was “Mason Ke Rang,” an Indi - an culture-based fusion dance team. As a kid, I had always wanted to get into dancing. When I saw the opportunity to invest myself in a dance team that would help keep me close to my cultural roots, I jumped at it. Not too long after, I heard about the Student Senate elections for Student Government. My high school didn’t have a student government, and al - though I had already joined a dance team, the idea of putting myself out there by running a campaign completely freaked me out. Then, I stopped and realized that maybe I was meant to embrace being out of my comfort zone so that I could learn from this new and challenging experience. That was exactly what I did, and after two weeks of campaigning, I was elected to the Student Senate. From these two experiences, I discovered that breaking out of my comfort zone was exactly what I wanted my college experience to be. I went on to look for any and every opportunity that I could that would allow me to do so. As a result, I joined a sorority from which I gained a support system that I didn’t even know that I needed; I studied abroad through an international internship program that allowed me to live in London while interning in Westminster for the British Parliament; I had two internships in the U.S. Department of State, within the Office of the Secretary; and I decided to run, and was elected to serve as the Student Body President. None of these were goals that I had when I had first stepped on my campus and thought about the potential that I had to make my college years amazing. But, as I began to challenge myself and push the limits of my comfort zone, I discovered that I could dream bigger. I pursued the opportunities to achieve each of these goals, and I am beyond thankful for the friends and family that I have had cheering me on every step of the way. When I leave from college, I know that I will carry this lesson of working hard and seeking the opportunities to achieve my goals – whatever they may be – everywhere I go!" ],
  [ "Love the Process and You’ll Love What the Process Produces", "Megan Sorlie", "University of Notre Dame", "I BEGAN PLAYING SOFTBALL when I was six years old. During those 16 years of playing, I learned a lot about the kind of player and person I wanted to be. However, I did not fully realize how much this game had given me until my last year playing at the University of Notre Dame. In January of my senior year at our annual retreat, my team and I spent a lot of time reflecting on past experiences that have shaped us into the people and players we have become. Before my coach dismissed us, she handed each player a piece of stationery and asked us to write a letter to the game of softball. Growing up, my father always showed me how to discover the lessons hidden within our experiences. So, in my letter to softball, I naturally reflected on all of the lessons this game has taught me over the past 16 years. Tears were streaming down my face as I finished my letter. I don’t think I had ever realized before that moment how much softball and its lessons had shaped me, especially during my four years at Notre Dame. Of all these things, I think the lesson that impacted me the most was learning to love and trust the process. After the first 16 games of my sophomore sea - son, my batting average was around 0.500. I was feeling on top of the world! Our team was winning, I was playing well, and I had rediscovered my love for the game. However, this high did not last long. I entered into the infamous “sophomore slump” and could not find my way out. My hitting coach told me over and over again, “Learn to love and trust the process of working through it.” I trusted her, but I couldn’t understand how I could love something that kept resulting in failure. I eventually lost my starting position in the lineup, confidence in myself, and the confidence of my coaches and teammates. At rock bottom, the words that kept coming back to me were, “learn to love and trust the process.” It seemed worth a shot because I did not have much else to lose. It turns out, learning to love the process was a process in and of itself. It was definitely not something I learned to do overnight. I learned that success isn’t always about the end result; it’s about the little victories you win along the way. I learned to let go of the past failures that were holding me back. I began living in the moment and playing as if every swing could be my last knowing that one day it would be true. Loving the process also meant realizing that there was no strength in solitude. I learned to lean on my teammates and coaches for help and support. I learned to bask in the struggle, because within it I stumbled upon my strength. My coach’s words reached beyond the softball field and resonated in all aspects of my life. In college, we students spend so much time waiting for things that we have no control over and in the process of waiting for a result, we miss out on experiencing the journey that brought us there. Ask any graduating senior, and they will tell you how fast college years fly by. So live in the present, love and trust the process, and have faith in something greater than yourself while you still have the time." ],
  [ "Trust the Process", "Uriel ‘Scout’ Ocampo", "UCLA", "AS YOU EMBARK on your journey to college or get a job right out of high school, like me, you will probably be confused about what you want to do for the rest of your life. High school was easy, it was structured and familiar. Now, you have to make decisions for yourself, and the future may seem daunting. There will be many obstacles that you will see coming from miles away, and others that will jump out of nowhere. Whatever your plans or dreams might be, the best advice I can give is to learn how to fall in love with the process of attaining your goals. At the end of the day, it will be you en - during the process to achieve your own aspirations. In his song “Love Yourz,” J.Cole said that there is “beauty in the struggle.” Honestly, I struggled academically at college and by no means was it pretty. I started at UCLA with the full intention of graduating with a degree in economics because I thought that is how I could achieve my own dreams of becoming a successful corporate lawyer. I quickly learned that I did not enjoy my economic studies, the competition was stifling and I did not do as well as I wanted to. At the end of my freshman year, I made the decision that I would explore other subjects the following quarter. After taking a variety of classes, I fell in love with statistics and the seemingly infinite possibilities of ways to apply it. However, to be a statistics major, I had to take multiple theory-based math classes, learn how to code, and take four to five classes each quarter to graduate in four years. I love stats, but mathematics is a different story. Taking on the intense course load each quarter meant I would allocate the majority of my time and effort toward studying and sleeping. When it came down to it though, I did not mind. I knew it was necessary in order to succeed. Turns out, the journey was just as difficult as I thought it would be, but looking back, I would not change a thing. I will be graduating in a couple of weeks with a statistics degree. The road was not easy, and I admit I lost touch with many of the people I met in the earlier parts of my collegiate career. However, I was fortunate enough to have friends who understood what I was trying to accomplish. Don’t get me wrong, I still had fun in college but it wasn’t exactly how I initially had envisioned it. Truth be told, I found the time constraints of my major liberating. I became better focused and reinvested my time in the people and things most important to me. Now, in the last week of my senior year, I realized that no matter what happens, you must never give up on your goals. Not everyone will be fortunate enough to take the path of least resistance, but you must always resist the urge to give up when the path you want to take seems and becomes arduous. Trust the process; I did, and to me, that has made all the difference." ],
  [ "The Strength in Vulnerability", "Caity Begg", "Harvard University", "I SAT IN WELD BOATHOUSE across from my coach. It was freshman year; second semester. My heart was beating through my chest. I burst into tears. I tried to explain how I loved my team but I just wasn’t happy at Harvard. I was depressed. The events of the first few weeks of college had left lasting scars on me. I asked my coach to sign a permission to contact form - a form allowing me to transfer and be rerecruited. She looked shocked, but her eyes were kind. She was so understanding. “You seemed like the happiest person on the team,” she said. On my official visits at Stanford and Penn the next few weeks I felt a pit in my stomach. I thought that running away from Harvard would make everything go away; make the pain evaporate. It did no such thing. I felt horrible. No one on my team knew what happened to me; no one knew I was severely depressed. I hid. I hid behind my extroverted disposition. I hid behind the pictures; the facades. I hid behind the weekends. I hid behind myself. I decided to stay because I felt like there was more to Harvard than the painful experiences that seemed to define my freshman year. I’ve found over the past few years that this was certainly the case. In high school I was the one who started touring colleges freshman year. The straight-A triathlete and varsity lacrosse player. I came to Harvard and felt like I didn’t ft in. I felt dumb. Like I didn’t belong. I also knew that if I came here and spent my time talking about how busy I was or how much work I had every night that I would go crazy. It would be a lie to say that every day since I’ve decided to stay at Harvard has been full of smiles and blissful happiness. There are still days and weeks when things are difficult for me. But often when I walk along the streets of campus, engage in a conversation with a friend about anything from our weekends to current political events, or glance down at my class ring when I’m at home it hits me, what an amazing place Harvard is. I’ve struggled with anxiety, depression, ADD, OCD (not to mention lung, foot, ankle, and shoulder injuries) while at Harvard. Maybe it’s not very noticeable through social media or when I walk around campus in bright colors with a smile on my face. But I’m sharing this in hopes that others on the Harvard campus and beyond will realize that we have all struggled at some point with something. And that it’s okay. It makes us more than a collection of filtered moments. It makes us human. True strength and self-confidence derives from embracing vulnerability. This is the single most important lesson I have learned during college." ],
  [ "Stay Curious", "Erik Zahnlecker", "UCLA", "STAY CURIOUS, pursue what you enjoy, do what makes you want to get out of bed everyday, and your college experience will be unforgettable and over way too fast. Out of high school, I was extremely unhappy at the first college I chose to attend. So what did I do? I took a path less traveled. Instead of thinking about what people would think about me leaving school, I decided to leave and attend a community college back home where I could finish my general edu - cation requirements, and then transfer. The dream school for me was UCLA. At the time, this leap of faith wasn’t an easy one to make. I risked social stigmatization for leaving university so soon, but I trusted my gut, and afterwards I couldn’t have been happier. Learning #1 – trust your gut and do what makes you happy. I did just that. I studied hard at the community college, got good grades, and transferred to UCLA as soon as I possibly could. When I got there, I had all of the things that I wanted in a university - including football games, Pauley Pavilion, diversity of opinions and cultures, great food, and incredible classes and classmates. Then came the job opportunities. While at UCLA, I got a summer investment banking internship, but quickly realized working 80-100 hours a week sucks, and that it made me extremely unhealthy and un - happy. Reiteration of learning #1. Now I was a bit unsure of what to do, so I applied on a whim for a Master’s at Stanford. I was fortunate to be accepted, and Stanford changed my life. At Stanford I met some of the most well-traveled, diverse, intellectually curious, hard working, and nice people that I have ever met in my life. These people soon became my great friends. We learned a considerable amount in the classroom, but I’d reckon we learned more from each other. At Stanford, I often worked until 2am, but unlike the investment banking job, I was studying things that actually interested me and that had applications in fields I found to be very exciting and meaningful. My graduate school experience gave me incredible insights. Importantly, I never thought some of my best friends would be from all around the world. Despite our cultural differences, humans are all incredibly similar, and at the core, share similar desires - Learning #2. Before gaining this perspective, I think I was someone who sometimes drew invisible boundaries between myself and other people. We construct these boundaries because of the safety we feel within them. However, after this realization, I try my hardest not to do this, as I think these invisible boundaries are responsible for some of the greatest problems we face in modern society. For me, staying curious and continually seeking out new opportunities outside of my comfort zone is what I enjoy, and has provided me with a life of experiences, perspectives, and friendships I never thought possible. As such, I’d recommend a tireless pursuit of whatever it is that makes you excited about getting out of bed, and I have no doubt you’ll find yourself in places you never imagined." ],
  [ "Explore Your Interests, Find Your Passion", "Kimberly Ostiller", "USC", "OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS, I’ve given more than 170 tours as a campus tour guide. The average tour has roughly 25 guests, so I can safe - ly assume I’ve welcomed around 3,400 guests to my campus. Prospective students and their families, alumni, donors, and other guests of the university often ask me, “What’s your least favorite part about USC?” “What’s one thing you wish you could change?” My answer often results in a chuckle or two, then the followup, “No, really. Tell me.” My primary fault with USC, if you can even call it that, is there’s al - most too much to do – too many choices. It’s a lovely burden to have. We offer more than 150 majors and 150 minors, nearly 800 clubs and student organizations, a music school that puts on 500 performances each year, 21 Division I sports teams, and countless other events, speakers and seminars. A delightful challenge students face is picking how they will spend their time. College is four years of self-discovery, learning, success and failure. The most important lesson I’ve learned in college is to explore your interests. Find - ing your passions will follow. Too often students enter college thinking they have to know what they’ll study, where they’ll live for the next four years and what organizations they’ll join. While more and more students enter college without a major, there still seems to be a stigma about not knowing what you want to do. Or if you’ve selected a major and decide to change it? There shouldn’t be even a tinge of embarrassment. How can you truly know what interests you if you haven’t necessarily had the chance to explore? For the most part, high schools’ academic curricula are fairly limited. As a high school upperclassman, maybe you can choose between calculus or statistics, but there aren’t nearly as many choices for classes — or extracurriculars for that matter — as there are in college. So even if something just slightly interests you — maybe you’re not passionate about it (yet) — you should dig a little deeper to see what can come of it. Figuring out what you like and what you don’t like will reveal what you’re truly passionate about. You can’t truly say you don’t like something unless you’ve tried it. The same goes for your involvement in college. Depending on the size of your school’s student activity catalogue, that process of elimination might take a little while, but don’t let that discourage you. So why not join a club and go to a few meetings. If you like the other members and the group’s activities, attend a few more sessions. If you’ve given it a shot and you’re just not feeling it? Surely there’s something else. The same goes for time in the classroom. If your course load permits, take a class or an elective outside your major or minor. Try something new. The resources available to you during your time in college are virtually limitless. The variety both inside and outside the classroom is unparalleled. Take these four years to be thoughtful but selfish. Use it as a time to learn not only what your brilliant professors teach you, but also learn about yourself, your likes, your dislikes. I’ve learned that there’s no one way to go through college, yet there is a right way. And the right way is to work hard, enjoy, and take advantage of all that your college or university offers." ],
  [ "Just Do It", "Alana Snyder", "Georgetown University", "I WALK THROUGH the front gates at Georgetown University one of my first days there as a student. I’m on my way to the activities fair. It’s the first chance I have to explore all the different student organizations on campus. I browse all the tables, one per group, but I come away from the fair a little disappointed. See, I had just graduated from Brentwood School in Los Angeles, where, in my senior year, some of my classmates and I planned and produced the inaugural It’s Our Turn Young Women’s Conference. This all-day event en - courages young women to be significant forces of change. At the Georgetown activities fair, I hoped to find something similar available to the women on my college campus. I would have even been happy with anything resembling a community of like-minded women that wanted to work together toward becoming strong leaders. When I didn’t find that, I knew I had to start something myself. Over the course of my college career I’ve learned to approach everything with the intention of doing it better than it has ever been done before. I like to think of it as doing everything with an entrepreneurial touch, seeking to make change in innovative and lasting ways. My passion for life, leadership, and learning inspired me to found Georgetown University Women in Leadership (GUWIL). The group’s mission is to bridge the gap between undergraduate life and the real world post-graduation through programming centered on careers, connections, and community. It’s pretty awkward to be college-aged because you have more independence than you ever did before, but you’re still not really a full adult; you’re sheltered. That shelter makes it easier to selectively take some risks. I’ve always been interested in the risks that are hardest to take, that could reap the highest rewards. Not just for me, but for the community, too. GUWIL was just that. There was a high potential it wouldn’t work out, but it did work and going forward the new leadership will continue promoting the organization’s mission encouraging the growth of more leaders. Part of what made me so confident GUWIL would succeed was knowing that I had a pre-determined strategy going into it. The goal was a big one with many different components so I learned quickly that tackling the challenge would be easier if it were broken down into steps. However, at the end of the day, no matter how much planning you do, there will still be things that come up that you couldn’t have anticipated. This fear was holding me back. However, once I stopped being afraid, I was able to better concentrate on what mattered, what I could control. GUWIL has taught me many things over the years, but, as I look back, I see that none of the subsequent learning opportunities would have been possible if I hadn’t founded the organization in the first place. So I leave you with this: just do it. Don’t be afraid to start something and to make your own success. Set the tone. Make you own operating goals so you know in which direction you are headed. Get organized. Figure out what you need to make your goals a reality. Make a schedule. Goals are nothing without something to keep you accountable. And finally, build an awesome team. Don’t go it alone-- share your success! " ],
  [ "Following Bliss", "Milad Razavi", "UC Berkeley", "I WANTED COLLEGE to be my springboard towards changing the world, and I believed that happiness could be sacrificed until my arbitrary notion of success had been reached. The problem with my approach, though, was that it treated happiness and success as final destinations, ultimately blinding me from viewing life as a meaningful journey. I attached my self-worth to external measures of validation and placed more value on how I thought others viewed my accomplishments than how I intrinsically viewed myself. I lived with a preconception of what the life I should have been striving for looked like, and without questioning it, stayed oblivious to what I truly wanted. Fear and dogma controlled me, and I disguised both as living rationally. What I couldn’t keep myself blind to, however, was how draining a life void of meaning is. This led me to the most important lesson of my college career: following bliss. Halfway through college, I noticed I was spending all of my time doing work I hated, sitting in boring meetings, or being too stressed about work I still had to do. The mental strain that accompanied the constant urge to bolster my resume and GPA turned me into a shell of the person I wanted to be; I didn’t have many friends and developed a lifeless personality. That all changed when I entered an international Red Bull Competition. I was dropped off in the middle of Europe, stripped of all my money and technology, and given seven days to travel as much as I could using nothing but cans of Red Bull as bartering currency. I begged thousands of strangers for help, snuck onto trains through the Italian Alps, explored castles in Prague, and loved every moment of it. I was making the most of my situation, and was having fun doing it. When I came home, I knew that fun needed to become part of my everyday lifestyle. By developing my interests into passions and let - ting them guide me, pleasure began to ensue in my work-life. I stopped aiming for success and happiness as end goals and instead started finding both along the way of what was now a life journey of meaningful personal growth. I’ve come to believe that living under a purpose that is rooted in love and selflessness can inject even the deepest of suffering or most mundane of activities with significance and joy. Moreover, I learned that happiness derives from the mindset I choose to live with, and realized it’s up to me to decide how I approach and reflect on my experiences. I started viewing the world with hopeful optimism rather than fearful cynicism. This taught me that the freedom to decide how I interpret my circumstances is the most powerful freedom I have. With purpose, passion, and a perception of life on my own terms, I was ready to live my bliss. I just needed to find it. Therein came the lesson that opportunities collapse or expand based on how often I replace fear of the unknown with curiosity. I learned that meaning lurks just outside of my comfort zone, and that with every second that passes, millions of doors open and close based on the decisions I make. Although it becomes inevitable to comfortably fall into a routine of taking the same doors every day, I learned the importance of exploring discomfort by opening unexpected doors. By getting lost on purpose, I learned that feeling disconnected from the person that I think I am allows me to drift into a better version of myself. Only by exploring darkness did I truly start understanding the essence of my light. I’ve learned that bliss exists when I let curiosity — not fear — guide me towards finding and living in love, no matter the form it takes. I believe that it takes passionate purpose, perceptive control, and imaginative spontaneity to find joy in everyday work. The unavoidable truth is that we’re all just fleeting guests on this planet, so why not find and follow your bliss until you’re living it?" ],
  [ "Be Flexible", "Bob Overing", "USC", "A LOT OF STUDENTS come to college as quite clueless freshmen – they don’t know what classes to take, what clubs to join or where to work over the summer. They’re constantly questioned by friends and family, “What’s your major? Have you decided yet? When are you going to decide?” But the single most important lesson I learned in college is when not to decide. The opposite end of the spectrum, having already decided everything, can be even more dangerous for a young college student. As a freshman, I came to USC to debate. I immediately met with the debate director when I was admitted, and I started working with the team during the summer before freshman year. I declared a Communication major to take all the speech and argumentation classes I could. I was all about debate, debate, debate, and I loved every minute of it. Traveling with the USC team and competing in tournaments across the country, from Texas to New York, are some of the best times I’ve ever had. I met my best friends and roommates on the team. They’re some of the most genuine and intelligent people I know, and we’ve spent hours upon hours practicing, studying, and laughing in the squad room. Yet after three years of competing, my plans changed. I had taken a philosophy course that real - ly affected me and how I think. A professor stopped me after class and said, “You really should declare a philosophy major.” That push, that little person - al encouragement meant a lot; I took a few more philosophy classes, and before I knew it, I was recommended and accepted to a progressive master’s program in Philosophy and Law. Entering the program meant I had to stop debating competitively to focus on my thesis. It was a tough choice, but I opened myself up to the possibility that I had found a new passion, and that might be okay. I spent a year and a half deliberating about what to do because a part of me felt a commitment to debate: if I stopped debating, it felt like I had made a mistake in spending all that time, just to abandon it. I decided to come to USC to debate, but I realized that my experience was so much more: the friendships, the professors, the outreach programs, and the wild student sections at football games. Through four years, I allowed myself to grow, change, and try new things, even when it was really difficult. As an eighteen-year-old, I didn’t know I wanted to study philosophy at all, and now I have been accepted to a top PhD program in philosophy. The greatest lesson I learned and advice I would give to future college students is to be flexible and open to possibilities. Don’t put yourself in a box by deciding too soon. Declare a chemistry major, but don’t call yourself a chemist just yet. Join a fraternity, but don’t call yourself a “frat guy” just yet. You have four years to help you mature into who you want to be, and if you’re flexible enough, nothing will break you." ],
  [ "The Right Place", "Charles Hawes", "UC Berkeley", "COLLEGE HAS TAUGHT ME many types of lessons. There have been small ones: having my housemates pay rent in twenty-ies makes for great Instagram videos (especially if that rent is in San Francisco). There have been big ones: that initiating dialogue is always a good idea, from your esteemed professor’s office hours, to the paunch-belly, bare-chested philosopher sitting next to you on public transit. There have been lessons learned the fun way: with the right amount of gusto, eat - ing cheesecake with your friends can be enjoyed in Macy’s furniture department. And there are ones learned the hard way: coffee filters aren’t an ideal replacement for toilet paper. I cannot fathom summarizing all the inane insights I’ve gained over these past four years. However, I can say that where the experience took place was often more important than what I did. In the last four years I have found myself in all kinds of places - from where I was, where I am now, and to where I am going. Moving from the meditative sway of coastal Oregon to the cacophony of San Francisco’s honks and horns has in many ways reflected my own personal development. The once-narrow understanding I had of the world has completely changed into one where I can see seemingly endless avenues. But in both the peaceful and the chaotic, the city and the beach, I have discovered that the positions best suited for growth are the ones furthest away from complacency, oftentimes on the precipice of exhaustion and exhilaration. The most fulfilling classes are the ones that have made me the most uncomfortable, the ethics class that kept me thinking way beyond the allotted weekly time slot and shaped how I view my place in the world, today. The most fun moments are not under some calm and collected pretense, but at three A.M. on the last bus home, delusionally laughing at a bottle of Sriracha your friend inexplicably smuggled out of a boring party. Whether following a whim of curiosity in the late-night, dusty shelves of the library to accompanying a cadre of your ecstatic peers to the next kickback, the moments on the edge of the unknown have always been the most fruitful in my path to self-discovery. The right placement is not easy to locate. So much of college is balancing the fatalistic and the future-oriented, and it’s easy to lose your head over the navigation. However, I have found that the silly and the productive are not mutually exclusive places; the balance of both is often the key to flourishing. Hours spent ruminating with a loved one on pad thai and poetry is not time wasted. Accepting that middle-of-the-week excursion to the top of Mount Tamalpais might result in a refreshed perspective on your studies, as well as an unforgettable memory with the ones you hold dear. I guess if I were to boil it down I would say, drink life in ‘till it spills down your shirt — just be sure to stand in a place where your friends can laugh with you while you do it. " ],
  [ "Actualize Your Personal Narrative", "James Stewart", "UC Berkeley", "SHIH, PITTINSKY, AND AMBADY conducted a study out of Harvard to examine the effects of stereotyping on a recipient’s life. In their experiment, researchers gathered women of Asian descent and split them into three groups. All three groups were given the same math test, but first, each received a different treatment. One group watched a video that presented statistics suggesting that ethnically Asian people tend to do better on math tests than other ethnic groups. Another group watched a video that presented statistics suggesting that women tend to do worse on math tests than men. The third group was the control. The result? Women who received the ‘Asian’ treatment scored the highest of the three and the women that received the ‘woman’ treatment scored the lowest. In learning about this study I understood that personal narratives—stories you tell yourself about yourself—tend to actualize in your daily decision-making and problem-solving processes. During my time in school, I had been working to actualize a personal narrative that, at first, came unnaturally to me. As cheesy as it sounds, one of my role models growing up was a fictional character named Dirk Pitt— the suave, talented protagonist in many of Clive Cussler’s novels. One part of Pitt’s character that I always admired was his ability to connect with anyone, from strangers in cafes in Tangier to fish shops in Uruguay. As a teenager, I did not have this trait. In large social situations, a natural social anxiety overcame any inclination I had to speak with even my neighbor up the street. This created a discontinuity. Because of that anxiety, I was not allowing myself to become the person I thought I was, or the person I wanted to be. Eventually, this disconnect provoked change. When I walked into a full room, I would ask myself: what would the person who I think I am do in this situation? Like the women of Asian descent who received the ‘Asian’ treatment and did better on the test, I came to reinforce an image of myself as an outgoing guy who was easy to get along with. Eventually, that reinforcement came to manifest itself as real change in my life. It is important to note that shaping personal narratives does not always yield positive change. During my time in school, I was fortunate enough to have several people confide in me. They shared their own stories of how someone they cared about hijacked their personal narratives. I learned that it is easy enough to blow off a stranger who calls you weak, incompetent, or dependent. However, it isn’t so easy to ignore those comments from a loved one. I mean to say that the damage is not necessarily done by the comments themselves, but by believing that the comments are true. Those who would see you diminish your view of yourself are poison and deserve no part in your life. But most importantly, I have learned that this time in college is when you can have this discovery. The next time you have a few extra minutes, I encourage you to think about the person you think you are. Are you satisfied with what you see? When you see the person you strive to be, are you proud? Do you feel like that person is an accurate representation of who you are or who you are trying to become? What will you do today to actualize that vision of yourself? Remember, as I have, to create your own personal narrative. It will reflect talent that shines from your genuine interests and positive self-perceptions." ],
  [ "You vs. You and the Battle for Achievement", "Taner Dagdelen", "UC Berkeley", "MOST EVERYONE HAS some goals when they are starting college. But the question is how do you actually achieve them? One of the biggest lessons I learned in college was that sheer willpower is not enough, no matter how determined you are. The only way to achieve your most ambitious goals is to find a way to get joy out of the day-to-day effort required to get there. Let me explain with a few examples. When I came to Cal, I set my sights on getting straight A’s. Borrowing the same bullheaded strategy that worked for me in high school, I told myself that I was going to get a 4.0 no matter the cost. Long hours with my nose in textbooks, a life devoid of social inter - action or even sunlight—whatever it took. I was running on willpower. As the semester kicked off, I ratcheted up my study regimen more and more, realizing how much harder I had to work to get an A in each of my classes. But soon I hit a wall that I had never hit before. I couldn’t seem to get myself to stick to my study plan. I could follow it for a day, maybe two, but then I would let it drop. Frustrated, a few days later I would redouble my efforts to stick to my plan, but again I would fail. I was constantly oscillating between successfully forcing myself to work and feeling like I was totally incapable of doing so. Despite my best efforts, I missed the 4.0 mark. The problem with willpower is that it is not an infinite and continuous resource. It works more like a battery. When we exert it, it gets discharged and we have to wait before we can use it again. We cannot will ourselves to have more of it, and unfortunately it tends to recharge slowly. By relying on willpower to achieve your goals, you are setting yourself up for burnout, frustration, and failure. Instead, you have to create an environment around you that turns your work into a source of instant gratification. To explain what I mean, I’ll give you another example, this time from my last semester at Cal. I was studying for the last final exam of my college career. It was in Computer Science 189: Introduction to Machine Learning. The course was way outside my field. As a bioengineer, I was missing 3 of the most critical prerequisites. I knew I was going to have to work harder than I ever had before to do well on the final. But instead of just willing myself to keep a tight study schedule, I focused on creating ways that I can get rewarded for studying hard, and by that point I had honed my tactics. I knew from previous classes that answering questions on Piazza (an online forum where students could post questions about the material for instructors and peers to answer) energized me, so I popped open the site. There were already some unanswered questions waiting for me, and reading them I instantly craved the jolt of joy I would get if I answered one correctly. I picked a question and dove into my textbooks and course notes. Like a dog checking his bowl for food, I shamelessly monitored the question to see if I would still be the first answer. Two-and-a-half full days of studying later, I threw up a long response, and within an hour there was a follow-up by my professor: “Well said.” That was all the motivation I needed. I continued posting on Piazza, having a blast the entire way, and in the end I got an A on the final. Of course, the point is not simply to motivate your studying by trying to help other students, though that might work for some people. The point is that for lofty goals, putting in the day-to-day work required to achieve them is not easy. Oftentimes willpower is not enough. But if you find a way to turn the consistent effort you have to exert into a source of joy, you’ll have all the energy and tenacity you need to get to the finish line." ],
  [ "The Importance of Relationships", "Alana Victor", "UC Berkeley", "THE GREATEST LESSON I have learned during these past four years stems from another question I am often asked, “What was your favorite thing about college?” Without hesitation, it is the importance of forming relationships with the people I have met. This response has remained unchanged, however the reason behind it has evolved. As I approached graduation, the more I understood just how important the people I met every day were to my undergraduate experience. Not all relationships were positive. However, no matter the encounter, I learned that it was import - ant to make the most of each one. Every person I met and connection I cultivated was a chance for discovery - to learn and grow. Looking back, I see that people have come into my life for different reasons. I realize that no matter how short, long, intimate or impersonal a relationship was, it was important. I will admit, sometimes it took a while to see the value in some of the paths I crossed, especially when the encounters were frustrating, uncomfortable or even upsetting. In student government, there were a few individuals whose blatant opposition to underrepresented student initiatives made my blood boil. As luck would have it, I most often encountered these individuals around the office. Once, during an organization-wide retreat, random groups were formed for a scavenger hunt and I remember think - ing, ‘please don’t put me with them.’ Of course, moments later, they announced us together. That day might have been one of the biggest tests of my patience. However, at the end of the day I learned more about collaboration working alongside some - one who had very different ideological views than someone with whom I already agreed. College has also had its more carefree, fun and casual encounters, which I often forgot to appreciate because they had become the norm. It was not until my final semester that I realized I needed to start appreciating the meetings with friendly faces during my bikeride to campus. These passing moments were easily overlooked but, on refection, truly brightened my days. My favorite was when I biked past someone whom I had not seen since freshman year or with whom I did not spend a lot of time. These fleeting yet joyful encounters remind me of the scope of wonderful people I have had the plea - sure of knowing. Curiously, I have found value in truly random emails that I received. One, in particular, evolved into a cherished relationship. While studying in Buenos Aires, Argentina, a university administrator emailed me after reading my column in our campus newspaper, the Daily Trojan. He said that an old friend of his was recently appointed Ambassador to Argentina and he offered to connect me with him. Several months later, when I was back in the U.S., I met the administrator at an off-campus event. I recognized his name and introduced myself. This reestablished connection evolved into a mentorship, and he is someone I now go to for advice. While this is a seemingly unique situation, it is much more common in a time when connections are made with a few clicks of a button. To me, however, the importance of relationships is not to have the mindset that every person is going to be a connection to your next job but, rather, the reason your day is just that much happier, insightful or fulfilled. I promise you, the people you meet will be what you remember most from college. It is certainly what I cherish most, the influence of professors, classmates, fellow members of organizations and friends. Not only are they my most treasured part of college, but they serve as a reminder that I must continue to strive for the very best in all relationships." ],
  [ "The Importance of the Question “Why?”", "Tucker Ring", "UC Berkeley", "IN RUDYARD KIPLING’S famous tale entitled “The Elephant’s Child,” he begins with the following poem: 
I keep six honest serving-men (They taught me all I knew); Their names are What and Why and When And How and Where and Who. Just like Kipling did a century ago in rhyme, almost every journalism student, past and present, can explain the centrality of these interrogative words—commonly referred to as the Five W’s (and one H)—in the process of collecting and organizing information. However, as integral as each of the six is to any reporting exercise, not all of these words were created equal. For the first half of my time as an undergrad in college, my usage of “why” was limited to what economists refer to as “positive,” or objective, statements. Why did the Romans invade Carthage? Why were fireworks invented in China? Why did the French Revolution occur? These questions seek answers that are rooted in generally uncontroversial facts: reasons of time, of place, of resources. However, this way of thinking slowly began to evolve near the end of the first semester of my junior year. One of the courses I was required to take, business ethics with the occasionally insolent Professor Ross, culminated at the end of the term with a lengthy research paper on a topic of our choice. Since I was taking three other major requirements, my first class ever in French, and working thirty to forty hours a week as a student equipment manager with my school’s football team, I knew that this ethics course would likely be my lowest priority of the semester. I rationalized that as long as the re - search paper was factually correct and grammatically sound, I could walk away from the class with the A I needed to keep my GPA competitive for graduate school and jobs. A few weeks after turning in my paper on the ethics of natural resource extraction in Africa, I received my score: B+. I was livid. I emailed the professor right away, politely demanding to meet so I could negotiate for a better grade in person. In the meeting, the professor explained that, although my paper met or exceeded most of the criteria in his grading rubric, what the paper did not touch on was why he, the professor, should care about my topic at all. He agreed that my research and factual basis was top-notch, but my persuasion—my pas - sion for the topic—was clearly nonexistent, and thus he could not justify changing my grade. That’s when it hit me. It took me five semesters of college to realize that while I might have nearly perfected the science of getting A’s, I had no idea how to convince others to care about my ideas. I slowly began to understand over the subsequent weeks that memorizing facts could only get me so far, both with my grades and in my life. What I needed was not better information, but rather better motivation. Instead of treating peers as competition on my way to better grades, they became inspiration for pursuing my own goals. I realized—or at least hoped—that the goal of a university education is not simply to read, review, and recite facts, but to seek answers to questions and higher truths that can be used to better guide human behavior, create good, prevent bad, and maximize happiness, while defining all those terms for oneself along the way. More so than just a journalistic tool, “why” forms the basis of our understandings of the world around us, ourselves, and our purpose. Now, when I see an issue in the world that simultaneously intrigues and challenges me, I start my inquiry by asking the question, “Why can’t I solve that?”" ],
  [ "Findings in Finding Yourself", "Julie Kaplan", "USC", "DANCE PARTIES, ROAD TRIPS, late-night talks with roommates who have become family, outlandish costume outings in public, pudding pie fights that turned into champagne showers, you name it. College has felt surreal in the best way possible. I’ll forever remember all I’ve learned about the power of supportive friendships and the importance of under - standing your own self-worth and potential. In high school, I always felt a disconnect between my peers and myself, as I’m sure many adolescents do. I picked my friends when I was very young and stuck with them through the years. We all grew up into individuals with different passions and various academic, social, and personal priorities. I longed for meaningful connections with others whom I felt truly understood my character and good intentions, desired the best possible outcome for me, and would emotionally support me with patience and empathy. However, I thought these types of friendships were fairytale-esque. Yet, college was an opportunity to pick your friends based on who you were now, rather than which clique you had always belonged to. My friend group is made up of unique individuals. I have a housemate who grew up on a raisin farm without any neighbours, another who grew up in the middle of violence in South Central Los Angeles, friends who grew up in small towns, and friends who grew up in suburban areas like myself. Despite our differences, we all share the same morals and value each other above all else. I’ve found such comfort in finding other people that cherish friendship and the well being of others around them as much as I do. I now see that the world isn’t meant to foster fear of depending too much on others, but it’s for allowing yourself to let others into your life and help you carry the weight of emotional hardship. I’ve learned an invaluable concept that friends are able to give you unconditional love just as family does. Embracing people with an open mind and heart, while also never failing to re - mind yourself that most people conduct themselves with the best of intentions, will help guide you in find - ing the right people that contribute to feelings of self-worth and the creation of home wherever you may be. The power of friendship led to a deeper sense of belonging in society that I didn’t know existed. I’ve learned how to take pride in myself. I’ve always struggled with feeling that I wasn’t significant enough to leave the lasting, positive marks on the world, when I so deeply yearned to. However, by junior year, every - thing shifted. School now felt like home. By actually letting myself believe that I was capable of making change, I did. The belief in myself that I’m important, worthy of love and acceptance, and that I can be the change that I want to see in my world around me, has finally led me to feelings of contentment. The support group that I found in college allowed me to see myself in a new and positive light. My social experiences led me to discover new skills and talents that I would never have been brave enough to pursue. Over the course of the year, I put thought into action and used my passions for understanding the underlying psychological aspects of people’s behaviors to enact positive change in children and their families’ lives. This newfound confidence has proven to me that believing in your own abilities leads to a feeling of competence and purpose. This raw sense of self has given me the irreplaceable feeling of being proud to be me. College has been a time of exploration in finding myself while getting to know others, leaving me confident and proud of the life I’ve created. The friends I’ve made will be lifelong. I’ll never forget first understanding the power in my own drive, passion, and potential. College is where you find yourself – that isn’t cliché. This feeling that presently exists within me of utter happiness for the perfect and imperfect aspects of my life is something that will forever make me remember that my college years are, were, and will always be some of the best of my life." ],
  [ "Save Me From the Lawyers", "Fraser Muir", "UC Berkeley", "“WHAT POSSIBLE JUSTIFICATION could there be for thinking that these transvestites should be able to choose which bathroom they use?” I was asked this question during lunch on my very first day at law school. I looked at the man; he carried all the smug self-satisfaction of someone who not only came from money, but to whom the world had never said ‘no’. I stared at him, trying to figure out if he was joking or not. I had made what I had thought to be a completely innocuous remark about a new law that had passed in California, commenting on how glad I was that trans issues were finally being taken seriously. After a daunting introductory lecture, I had found a group of people and nervously attached myself for lunch, hoping to make friends in the same lighthearted way I had in college. However, the conversation quickly turned south. I would like to say that I jumped in and delivered a maelstrom of statistics and smart-assed retorts to his ridiculous question, but I found myself quite unable to speak. I could tell instantly that this was not going to be like my undergraduate experience. I looked around at the inquisitive stares, anticipating my reply – they looked to me as toads contemplating a particularly juicy fly – and I knew that things had changed. My undergraduate experience at UC Berkeley was the best time of my life. I found my people in college. My friends were always supportive, always asking for my opinion and never making me feel stupid or inadequate. There was an atmosphere of positivity and openness that was fostered by an ever present feeling of safety. I could grow and question, be challenged by and learn from my peers, but al - ways feel that I was afforded respect for my opinions. Berkeley was an incubator for my identity. I went in feeling confused, lost and awe-inspired and I left feeling confident, well-rounded and happy. The world was my oyster and I was going to kill it at law school. Go me! However, after my first encounter with this new breed of law students had gone slightly awry, I was doubtful that my new university would offer the same safety upon which I had relied so heavily as an undergrad. Law school is inherently adversarial; we’re learning about a system that is designed to pit everyone against one another, and when factoring in the competitive nature of the profession and what it takes to secure a coveted position in a barristers’ chambers, the furious competition is almost intolerable. The comfort is gone. The support is gone. The only person looking after my best interests is me, and every facet of my belief system and every academic assertion I make is questioned and probed. The relentlessness of it all is exhausting, and sometimes I wonder whether I’ve made a horrible mistake in choosing this as my profession. I’m facing the end of this degree less with a sense of optimism, and more a feeling of impending dread. It occurred to me that day, when I was asked that affronting question at lunch, that the real value in going to Berkeley was not to be found in any quantifiable metric. I had found a self-assuredness I never knew I had, both in myself and my beliefs. Whilst the atmosphere at law school has been nothing if not hostile, I’m somewhat grateful for the ignorant questions. It’s easy to believe in something when everyone else agrees with you; it’s damn hard when everyone thinks you’re an idiot for it. Whereas I was once one of many, now I’m a true oddity. The liberal lawyer, that one guy who’s crazy enough to think that he can use the law to advance his bizarre socialist agenda, the guy from the Bay who has clearly been smoking too much grass; these are all things people have said about me. But I don’t care, and I’m happy that I don’t ft their conventions nor meet their standards. Berkeley gave me the space to develop my ideas and law school has served to trim the fat. As I finish law school, my perspective on life and my ability is now not only optimistic, it’s realistic too. I’m excited about the future, but wary of it too. And above all else, I’m grimly determined in a way I wasn’t before. " ],
  [ "Parties and Papers", "Jackson Rees", "UC Berkeley", "EVERYONE IS OBSESSED with having a fulflling college experience. This is probably due to the fact that from a young age we are bombarded with images from movies, TV shows, and popular songs about what it means to be a college student. If you were to base your ideas of student life off everything popular culture tells us it is, you might think it’s some - thing like this: Every night you should be dancing on some sticky tabletop holding a red solo cup filled with a poorly mixed, toxic elixir while you tongue wrestle some hot stranger to the beat of Lil Jon yelling one-syllable words over some bass-boosted electronic track. Be - hind you people are doing keg stands, a chubby frat bro is channeling his inner primate as he breaks a beer can over his forehead, and some kid is jumping into a pool from a rooftop. The next morning you proceed hungover to your unconventional college class that takes place outside because your professor isn’t a product of the machine and doesn’t subscribe to capitalism or chalkboards. That night you would start the whole process over again, and if you don’t, you’re doing college “wrong.” Society has told us that in these four years we have to balance the sex, drugs and ‘rock n roll’ lifestyle in addition to success, achievement and enlightenment. This isn’t college. Or rather it’s some of college, but college has so much more to offer than parties and papers. I started my senior year in a panic. I was running out of time to finish the mental checklist I was keeping of all the things I needed to do in order to “do college right.” How could I look back on these four years with pride if I hadn’t spent spring break in Cabo, or streaked naked through the library? But then it dawned on me. Despite all the things I still hadn’t experienced during my time at university I was really happy. How was this possible?! It seems silly and like it belongs on some cheap Hallmark card, but as long as you’re happy, and doing what makes you happy while you’re in college, who’s to say you’re wrong? I started to question where all these arbitrary metrics of a fulfilling college experience came from and determined it was just a handful of stories being romanticized by the media. College is fulfilling because it happens just the way it needs to for those who take part. College is about learning and growing — yes, academically of course — but also socially, politically, and emotionally. We get so wrapped up in the things we haven’t experienced during college that we don’t appreciate the things we do, and the lessons they teach us. Don’t let society tell you what has worth and what doesn’t — that’s for you to decide. The Animal House-esque college situations certainly have their place, but I’ve found that I usually walk away from them feeling less fulfilled than when I get an A on a midterm, or take a day trip to hike in the foothills. But hey, that’s just me, and that’s the whole point. Have the college experience you want to have, and if its not found in some movie, who cares?" ],
  [ "The Happiest Accidents", "Leah Romm", "UC Berkeley", "I ONCE TURNED TO A FRIEND and jokingly told him I wished I had studied statistics so I could calculate the odds of us meeting. We both came to Berkeley in overlapping years, joined the Student Advocate’s Office, took on its top two leadership positions and, through it all, became close friends. Though the possibility of pinpointing some number seemed fascinating, I happily waved the thought away. Better to wonder less and enjoy it more, I thought to myself. I study English at Berkeley. In other words, I read a lot of novels, poems, and essays, and I think about how certain words in certain orders work. I try to understand why one collection of words makes us cry, while another makes us laugh. After all, sounds, and then letters, and then words, and then written language all came together accidentally. Why did the shape of the letter “A” lead us to think of the sound “ay” or “ah,” and why does the collection of letters B-O-O-K make us think of a bunch of pages of text bound together to create a document that aims to communicate some level of truth? These were mere accidents, as many of the best things are. The friend you might grow closest to as a freshman happens to live down the hall from you. You would not have met otherwise. He studies the environment, and his classes are on the opposite side of campus. You meet because a computer generated a selection of tenants to live on the third floor of your dormitory. A student organization runs out of fliers immediately after putting one in your mailbox. You get one of the last fliers. You apply. They accept you. Three years later, you look back and realize it’s the most meaningful work you’ve ever done. You could have joined any other group on campus, but you joined this one. There are tens of thousands of students on cam - pus, but these are the ones who were chosen to work alongside you, and these are the ones who laugh at, think about, and love the same things you do. For the most part, you would not have met them otherwise. You’re running the organization now, and you make sure to print extra fliers for recruitment. There are a lot of people who may be similar to you at your university. They might also cry at every Christmas episode of The West Wing, or maybe they also did competitive civics in high school, or maybe they, too, light up when they talk about their favorite book. Of these tens of thousands, you happen to meet one on the other side of the country when you both spend a summer working in DC. Over more beers than planned and an impromptu trip to the Lincoln Memorial, you might discover that you share so much: immigrant backgrounds, a healthy obsession with Hafz poems, and an unwavering reliance on the phrase, “this too shall pass,” among other things. Notice, then, how incredibly comforting it is to meet someone just like you when you could have met any of the other tens of thousands who may have been only a bit like you. And despite all odds, you didn’t even meet at school. You find someone through social media before you even start at the same school. You post a lot of the same stuff. You decide to meet once school starts. Now, you turn to her for guidance, for music, for silly puns and sillier cat photos. She gets you like no one else does. Tens of thousands, and she was the one who reached out to you a few months before your first semester. Someone lives on the floor below you in the dorms your first year. You don’t interact much over the years, but you cross paths occasionally. So when he and the friends he has made over the years decide to publish a book, and he asks you to be a part of it, you think of all the other people he could have asked instead. And you wonder if any element of your lives had been different, would you have had this chance? You agree— you’ll try to write something good. These opportunities don’t arise too frequently. When you consider how many people there are in the world—when you even stop to consider how many hundreds you pass by every single day without ever noticing—you can’t help but wonder, like I once did, the odds of meeting this person or that one. Seven billion, and yet you’ll meet your best friends, your mentors, your lovers, your second families. And one day, completely by accident, you’ll stumble upon yourself, too. You’ll be lying on the rooftop of your first apartment, or walking through campus on a particularly sunny day, or talking to someone at what’s become your favorite cafe, and, for the first time, you’ll feel just as you should. You’ve been fidgeting around, trying to ft comfortably in your skin, and that one random twist or turn will place you just right. You will feel whole. It will never be planned. It will always be by accident." ],
  [ "Final Exam", "Charlotte Anderson", "UC Berkeley", "Name: Charlotte Anderson Class: College Date: Graduation Day Final Exam Section 1 – Multiple Choice Question 1: If you were cut from your college’s Division I cross country team right before your senior season, how would you react? A. Write an opinion article bashing the coach who cut you B. Transfer and run for another school C. Succumb to self-pity and quit running forever D. Acknowledge the disappointment but stick out senior year, using the extra time to tutor local under - privileged students, ultimately receiving the university’s highest leadership honor Question 2: If your dad, sister, brother, and boy - friend all died unexpectedly in the span of less than two years, how would you react? A. Start a research foundation charity in honor of the disease that killed your brother B. Exude strength and positivity by encouraging everyone to “hug those closest to you extra tight” C. Smile and celebrate the lives of those you love D. All of the above Question 3: If your best friend ignored your call - ing for the ball during softball practice so that the resulting collision gave you a seizure, concussion, a black eye, and a torn lip right before playoffs, what would you do? A. Blame her and grumble about how she is play - ing while you have to sit out, injured B. Hide your swollen face in embarrassment C. Give into fear about stepping back on the field D. Forgive your friend, joke about your temporarily grisly appearance, and take the field again in just seven days, later earning the university’s student athlete spirit award Section 2 - Free Response: What was the most important lesson you learned in college? “It is our choices that show what we truly are.” (Bonus question: Who said it? Answer: If you don’t know, please head to the nearest bookstore and ask about a brilliant woman named J.K. Rowling). Our generation uniquely faces a world overflowing with multiple choices. We Google questions every day and enjoy the instant gratification of thousands of responses. But I have learned that the most important lessons are found not in the words of a webpage, a textbook, or an answer key, but in the quotidian responses of those around you to life’s toughest questions. Communicated through small, nearly unnoticeable daily acts, these elusive answers can only be received by a compassionate ear, an observant eye, and a reflective mind. A single “right” answer cannot be bubbled in for each of the millions of questions, large and small, that characterize the exam of life. Who am I? How can I give of myself to others? What is more precious to me than anything else in the world? The most important skill I learned in college was not producing the correct responses on the plethora of exams I took, but rather mastering the art of ceaselessly pursuing an understanding of how to assess and evaluate my - self. Paying attention to the answers of friends like Megan, Caroline, and Meg to some of life’s most important questions has taught me how to respond to life’s crazy curveballs with strength, gumption, and grace. In moments of struggle and triumph alike, are you paying attention to, truly learning from, the everyday actions of others? How would you respond? What will you choose?" ]
